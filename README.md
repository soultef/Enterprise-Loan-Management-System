Description

Enterprise Loan Management System (ELMS) is an open-source, enterprise-grade application that manages the full lifecycle of bank loans — from application submission to approval, tracking, and reporting.

Built using Java Spring Boot, ELMS follows best practices in DevOps, CI/CD, containerization, and cloud orchestration, ensuring secure, scalable, and maintainable banking operations.
