🌟 Enterprise Loan Management System (ELMS)

📝 Description

Enterprise Loan Management System (ELMS) is an open-source, enterprise-grade application that manages the full lifecycle of bank loans — from application submission to approval, tracking, and reporting.
Built using Java Spring Boot, ELMS follows DevOps, CI/CD, containerization, and cloud orchestration best practices, ensuring secure, scalable, and maintainable banking operations.

Submit, track, and manage loan applications.

🔄 Workflow Engine
Multi-level loan approval workflows powered by Camunda BPM.

🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Secure access with Keycloak integration and separation of duties (SoD).

🛠 CI/CD & Automation
Gradle builds, automated tests, SonarQube code quality checks, and deployment pipelines.

🐳 Containerized Deployment
Docker and OpenShift / OKD orchestration across DEV, TEST, UAT, and PROD.

📣 Messaging & Notifications
Asynchronous event handling using Apache Kafka.

📈 Observability
Logging via ELK Stack and metrics monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.

📦 Artifact Management & Rollback
Versioned artifacts in Artifactory/Nexus with easy rollback support.
