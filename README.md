# Enterprise-Loan-Management-System (ELMS)
Enterprise Loan Management System (ELMS) is an open-source, enterprise-grade application designed to manage the full lifecycle of bank loans — from application submission to approval, tracking, and reporting.

### Description:
Enterprise Loan Management System (ELMS) is an open-source, enterprise-grade application designed to manage the full lifecycle of bank loans — from application submission to approval, tracking, and reporting. Built using Java Spring Boot, ELMS follows best practices in DevOps, CI/CD, containerization, and cloud orchestration to ensure secure, scalable, and maintainable banking operations.

### Key Features

#### Loan Management: Submit, track, and manage loan applications.

#### Workflow Engine: Multi-level loan approval workflows powered by Camunda BPM.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Secure access with Keycloak integration and separation of duties (SoD).

#### CI/CD & Automation: Gradle builds, automated tests, SonarQube code quality checks, and deployment pipelines.

Containerized Deployment: Docker and OpenShift / OKD orchestration for DEV, TEST, UAT, and PROD environments.

Messaging & Notifications: Asynchronous event handling using Apache Kafka.

Observability: Logging with ELK Stack and metrics monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.

Artifact Management & Rollback: Versioned artifacts in Artifactory/Nexus with easy rollback support.
